Iâ€™m Ricky Woznichak, a passionate digital marketing professional and current M.S. candidate in Digital Marketing at Cal Poly Pomona. Prior to my stint as an actor, I cut my teeth as an Assistant Digital Media Planner at UM, crafting campaigns for clients like Sony Home Entertainment and IHOP. Along the way I also honed my storytelling and people skills as a substitute teacher andâ€”true storyâ€”an awesome waiter. Iâ€™ve led SEO initiatives, mastered tools like Google Analytics and SEMrush, and built interactive R and Quarto dashboards that turn complex insights into clear action. When Iâ€™m not geeking out over forecasting models for my Productfolio.com thesis, youâ€™ll find me strolling with my dog Jimmy â€” because great ideas often strike when youâ€™re off screen.
